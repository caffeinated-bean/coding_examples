### Example problem list:

*Example 1: Create a Caesar Cipher*
With a Caesar Cipher you are giving a key (say the number 3) and all of the letters of the alphabet rotate that many number of spaces over. Can you create a function that can encrypt/decrypt a message using the ceasar cipher?
Extreme bonus points for creating a decrypter than can decrypt caesar's cipher without a key.
